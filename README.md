# QA Automation

This project focuses on basic utility class developers with selenium and JavaScript executor. In previous projects I created utilities that were too complex for the early stages and slowed down skill development. Through this project I strengthened the interaction of elements and simplified the foundation to be more efficient, stable, and reusable.
